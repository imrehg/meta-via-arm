This README file contains information on the contents of the
meta-via-arm layer.

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.

Supported Machines
==================

At the moment the following VIA boards and systems are supported:

* VAB-820 Quad

This layer aims to support all VIA ARM devices on the long term,
and will add devices over time.

Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake
  branch: master

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
  layers: meta
  branch: fido

  URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-fsl-arm
  branch: fido

Patches
=======

Please submit any patches against the vab820-bsp layer to the
relevant Github issues page, or to the maintainer:

I. Adding the vab820-bsp layer to your build
=================================================

a. Getting the dependencies
---------------------------

The easiest way to get the dependencies for this layer is to follow
the instructions for the FSL community BSP, and then add this layer
to the ones contained in that BSP.

The install instructions can be found online at:
http://freescale.github.io/#download

Then copy this layer into the `source` folder in the setup created by
the steps above.

b. Setting up this layer
------------------------

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the vab820-bsp layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the vab820-bsp layer to `bblayers.conf`, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    ${BSPDIR}/sources/poky/meta \
    ${BSPDIR}/sources/poky/meta-yocto \
    \
    ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
    ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-multimedia \
    \
    ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-fsl-arm \
    ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-fsl-arm-extra \
    ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-fsl-demos \
    ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-via-arm \
  "


II. Usage
=========

a. Machines
-----------

This repo provides the machine description for `vab820-quad`, that can be
used with the basic openembedded images, or with mx6q images provided by
Freescale.

b. Known Issues
---------------

Currently not all patches are reused from the VIA VAB-820 BSP (that is
developed on an older release of Yocto). The command line interface
works, but the graphical interface output through HDMI is not yet available.
